## Synopsis

Playing around with the SnapSVG library to learn more from JavaScript

## Motivation

I love animation and visual design. Since I'm learning JavaScript I want to do this on a fun way. SnapSVG makes these come together. This library is very cool for user experience design in later projects.

## Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

## API Reference

None.

## Tests

Tests for this project are done bij logging to the console and testing it out in Apple Safari. Unfortunate the code doesn't work in Chrome (local) because of the usage of AJAX.

## Contributors

Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.

## License
